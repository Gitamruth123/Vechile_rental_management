Project Description
The C# console application, named the Vehicle Rental Management System, was developed to manage the daily operations of a vehicle rental business.
This system enables vehicle addition, removal, and rental, facilitating fleet management for cars, trucks, and motorcycles. It also tracks the total revenue generated from rentals.
Object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation are used in the construction of the system.
The Car, Truck, and Motorcycle classes inherit from the Vehicle class, which acts as the foundation class and adds unique attributes and behaviors.
The overall management of the fleet and rental activities is handled by the RentalAgency class.

Setup Instruction
To set up the Vehicle Rental Management System, ensure you have Visual Studio or any C# compatible IDE and the .NET SDK installed.
